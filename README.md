# Multi-function-Calci
Multifunction calculator that is menu-driven and user-friendly. The calculator can perform basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) as well as advanced operations like square root, power, and even trigonometric functions.

How It Works:

-Functions: There are separate functions for each mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, etc.), along with functions for trigonometric operations (sine, cosine, tangent) and other advanced operations (square root and power).

-Menu: A user-friendly text-based menu is displayed after each operation, allowing the user to choose an operation.

-User Input: After the user selects an operation, the program prompts for the necessary numbers to perform the calculation. The program also handles invalid inputs, ensuring a smooth user experience.

-Exit Option: The program exits if the user chooses option 0.


Key Features:

-User can perform basic arithmetic and advanced mathematical operations.

-Handles edge cases like division by zero and square roots of negative numbers.

-Trigonometric functions work with angles in degrees.

-The user can choose to exit the program at any time.
